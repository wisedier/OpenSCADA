This example illustrates starting an Idle PLC and a Communications module.
The PLC runs in the background but its RAM and ACCESS PATHS are exposed to
the coomunications module which may read/write to them.

Running the example
-------------------
1.Start the PLC
>> cd ~/OpenSCADA;
>> bazel run :example_idle_plc


2.Start the Communications module in a new terminal
>> cd ~/OpenSCADA
>> bazel run :example_comm_module

3.Stopping the PLC when done:
Press Ctrl-C in the terminal

Description
-----------
The PLC is first started. It initializes and exposes its RAM and Access paths.
When the communication module is run, it reads/updates some memory locations
and access paths.
